## Overview
A beautiful, single-screen onboarding experience inspired by modern mobile app design patterns.

## Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Light, clean background** (#F8F9FA) for a modern feel
- **Card-based illustration container** with subtle shadows
- **Rounded bottom sheet design** for content area
- **Professional typography** with clear hierarchy
- **Smooth button styling** matching your app's design system

### Layout Structure
- **Top section (65%)**: Illustration area with placeholder
- **Bottom section (35%)**: Content area with title, description, and CTA button
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Safe area aware**: Properly handles device notches and status bars

### Content
- **Engaging title**: "Split Bills with Friends Effortlessly! ðŸ’°"
- **Clear description**: Explains the app's value proposition
- **Strong CTA**: "Let's Start!" button for immediate engagement

## Implementation Details

### Image Integration
The screen is designed to use your illustration at:
```
./assets/onboarding/onboarding.png
```

To use your actual illustration:
1. Place your `onboarding.png` file in the `assets/onboarding/` directory
2. Uncomment the Image component in `ModernOnboardingScreen.tsx`
3. Comment out or remove the placeholder illustration

### Components Used
- **SafeAreaView**: Handles device-specific safe areas
- **Custom Button**: Uses your existing Button component
- **Typography**: Consistent with app's text styling
- **StatusBar**: Properly configured for light theme

### Navigation
- **Entry point**: Set as initial screen in navigation
- **Exit action**: Navigates to Home screen when CTA is pressed
- **No back navigation**: Uses `replace` to prevent returning to onboarding

## Files
- `src/screens/ModernOnboardingScreen.tsx` - Main component
- `assets/onboarding/onboarding.png` - Your illustration (to be added)

## Customization
You can easily customize:
- Colors by updating the StyleSheet
- Text content by modifying the title and description
- Illustration by replacing the placeholder
- Button styling through the Button component props

This creates a professional, conversion-focused onboarding experience that matches modern app standards.
